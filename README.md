This repository demonstrates a subtle error that can occur in HTML when using the innerHTML property. The error is caused by attempting to assign a numerical value directly to the innerHTML property of an element, rather than a string.  While this might not always throw an error, it often leads to unexpected results. The solution shows the correct way to handle this situation by converting the number to a string before assigning it to innerHTML.
